''Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.''

# Use popular tools such as Plotly, Mermaid, and data frames.

## Coming Soon

# Wowchemy supports the popular [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) format for interactive data visualizations. With Plotly, you can design almost any kind of visualization you can imagine!

# Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example `line-chart.json`, and then add the `{{</* chart data="line-chart" */>}}` shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.

# Demo:

# {{< chart data="line-chart" >}}

# You might also find the [Plotly JSON Editor](http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/) useful.

# Wowchemy supports the _Mermaid_ Markdown extension for diagrams.

# An example **flowchart**:


# Save your spreadsheet as a CSV file in your page's folder and then render it by adding the _Table_ shortcode to your page:

# ```go
# {{</* table path="results.csv" header="true" caption="Table 1: My results" */>}}
# ```

# renders as

# {{< table path="results.csv" header="true" caption="Table 1: My results" >}}
