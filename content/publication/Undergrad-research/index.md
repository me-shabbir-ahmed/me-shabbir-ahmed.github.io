abstract: The analysis of two dimensional (2D) flow over NACA 0012 airfoil is validated with NASA Langley Research Center validation cases. The k-ω shear stress transport (SST) model is utilized to predict the flow accurately along with turbulence intensities 1% and 5% at velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively. The computational domain is composed of 120000 structured cells. In order to enclose the boundary layer method the enhancement of the grid near the airfoil is taken care off. This validated simulation technique is further used to analyse aerodynamic characteristics of plain flapped NACA 0012 airfoil subjected to different flap angles and Mach number. The calculation of lift coefficients (CL), drag coefficients (CD) and CL/CD ratio at different operating conditions show that with increasing Mach number (M) CL increases but CD remains somewhat constant. Moreover, a rapid drastic decrease is observed for CL and an abrupt upsurge is observed for Cd with velocity approaching to the sonic velocity. In all cases range and endurance are decreased, as both values of CL/CD and √CL/CD are declined.
