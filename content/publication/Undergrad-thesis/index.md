abstract: In this paper, guided simply supported beams are considered in order to analyze their elastic field due to a three point bending loading. By a new approach of displacement potential formulation, the present mixed boundary value elastic problem is expressed in terms of a single potential function. Displacement and stress components are derived into infinite series using Fourier integral with the coincided boundary conditions along with the physical boundary conditions. Numerical results of different stress and displacement components at different sections of the beam are presented. The effect of beam aspect ratio on the solution of stresses and displacements at a particular section is also analyzed.
