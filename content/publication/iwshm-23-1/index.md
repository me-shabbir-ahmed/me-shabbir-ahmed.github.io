abstract: A multifunctional energy storage composite (MESC) combines the high energy density of lithium-ion batteries with the structural benefits of carbon fiber composites, resulting in a lightweight structural battery with excellent mechanical strength and enhanced safety for electric vehicles (EVs). This paper presents the design-tofabrication development of new MESC, with a specific focus on the design, fabrication,
and testing of an electronic skateboard (e-skateboard) as a representative system-level study for the EVs. A finite element analysis (FEA) is employed to design the MESC eskateboard. The FEA of the MESC e-skateboard is validated through mechanical testing, demonstrating a significant 24% reduction in weight, leading to an impressive 31.6% improvement in energy density compared to a conventional e-skateboard. As a part of the MESC technology, an embedded smart sensor network is also developed for the e-skateboard, showcasing the capability for real-time battery monitoring, and estimating its state of charge during in-service operation. The promising outcomes of the new MESC technology position it as a novel solution for enabling multifunctional structural battery composites in future electronic vehicles and aircraft applications.
