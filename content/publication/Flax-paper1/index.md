abstract: In order to develop and improve bio-inspired fibers, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of the fracture behavior of bio-fibers such as flax fibers from an individual fiber down to the constituent micro-fibrils and nano-fibrils. For investigating the failure mechanism of individual and technical flax fibers, a tensile test bench was placed within a scanning electron microscope, and the entire process of fiber failure was investigated through the capture of an SEM movie. Next, fractographic analysis was performed on the failure surface of single fibers as well as meso-fibrils that failed at a displacement rate of 0.25 mm/min, 0.75 mm/min, and 1.6 mm/min. The analysis also enabled visualization of a few internal details of flax fiber such as the arrangement of meso-fibrils and micro-fibrils (nano-fibrils). It was shown that the crack bridging mechanism and successive fiber pull-out contributed to the high work of fracture of flax fiber and the value may reach as high as 106 J/m2.
